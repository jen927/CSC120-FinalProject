## Reflection
I first began by brainstorming ideas of a story based game, like a chat room where the player can interact with characters. Since I decided to do the project on my own, I decided on a adventure game where the number of enemies and the number of weapons a user holds impacts their power level. I wished I had worked more on the story part of the game because I really wanted to add some easter eggs or clues about the past civilation and how the world became overrun with magic. I think that could have something cool players could have explored in areas when there weren't any enemies.
I leared how to work with a text file and used BufferedReader to my advantage. Knowing I could change aspects to the story as long as the format stayed the same was very helpful during the last few days. Also, having the reader be a private method other public methods in the classes could rely on really helped clean my code. Honestly, this project got me really familiar with text file readers.
I still not sure if it would have easier and more clean if I used multiple text files for different Areas or by different locations, but having one text file with the information wasn't too hard to navigate as long as I was care with the beginning of each line and having every thing formatted exactly the same.
The most useful piece of advance I recieved was when I was given starting points during the first workshop. I was stuck on where to start and she gave me a starting point and from there, I built everything slowly.
Although, I am sure there are bugs somewhere in my code when the game progresses towards the end, I learned a lot from this project and I am mostly proud of all I've learned in this class. If I had more time, I would try to fix the looping of the location description when an enemy has been defeated for example.
